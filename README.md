# Project One: Iris flowers types Classification

As humans we can easily classify objects just by looking at them, smelling them or touching them. using our senses i essential to do so , but hat about machines ?

in this project i made a machine learning program that you feed it with data about the Flower's:
> petals length & width
> Sepals length & width

so it classify it to tell you if it was:
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Virginca
