# Model One: Iris flowers types Classification

As humans we can easily classify objects just by looking at them, smelling them or touching them. using our senses i essential to do so , but what about machines, can they learn from data so they can classify by their own ?

in this Model i made a machine learning program that you feed it with data about the Flower's:
> petals [ length & width ].

> Sepals [ length & width ].

so it classify it and tell you if it was:
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Virginca

    i needed to feed my model with data so it can process it and learn from it.
