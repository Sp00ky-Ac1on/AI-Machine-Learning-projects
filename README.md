# Model One: Iris flowers types Classification

As humans we can easily classify objects just by looking at them, smelling them or touching them. using our senses i essential to do so , but what about machines, can they learn from data so they can classify by their own ?

in this Model i made a machine learning program that you feed it with data about the Flower's:
> petals length & width.

> Sepals length & width.

so it classify it and tell you if it was:
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Virginca

## Process & Coding Steps :

## 1- Collecting th needed data 
i needed to feed my model with data so it can process it and learn from it.
you can find the flower's data included in the [repo](https://github.com/AnanSoli/)

## 2- preparing the data
 - you will need the following python libraries in this model

> pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

 - add the following code to open and save the iris data into a dataframe
